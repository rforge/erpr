\title{
	locate ms on a ERP plot
}
\description{
This functions is meant to be used with a plot obtained with \code{\link{erp}} function. It reads the position of the graphics cursor when the (first) mouse button is pressed and returns the x-coordinates in ms. 
	}
\usage{
ms.locator(type = "p", startmsec, endmsec, lengthsegment, label=TRUE, n=512, ...)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{type}{
	the type of plot. this parameter is passed to \code{locator}
}

  \item{startmsec}{
     the time (in ms) of the start of the segment.
}
  \item{endmsec}{
     the time (in ms) of the end of the segment.
}
  \item{lengthsegment}{
    the length (in points) of the segment.
}
	\item{label}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the located ms are plotted on the figure.
}
	
	\item{\ldots}{further parameters to be passed to \code{locator} function.
}
	
	\item{n}{The maximum number of points to locate.
}

}

\value{
The time in ms associated with each located point is printed on the \code{R} prompt.
