\title{
localmax
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
localmax(x, n=2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a vector of numbers.
}
  \item{n}{
the minimum numbers of lower values to determine the local maximum (see Details). Default is two points.
}
}
\details{
The function calculates the local maximum of the vector \code{x}, i.e. the highest value of the vector \code{x} surrounded by at least \code{n} lower numbers. The concept of local maximum applied to ERP analysis is taken from Luck (2005).
}
\value{
The local maximum of the vector \code{x} is returned.
