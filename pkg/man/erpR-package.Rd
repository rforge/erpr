The \code{erpR} package is dedicated to the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). Event-related potentials are the measured brain responses associated with a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event and are obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. The \code{erpR} package contains a series of functions for importing Event-related potentials (ERP) data, carrying out exploratory analyses, computing traditional ERP measures and ERP plotting. Many \code{erpR} functions require to specify two arguments: \code{base} and \code{numbers}. The names of the objects for the \code{erpR} functions are obtained from the combination of \code{base} and \code{numbers}. The argument \code{base} typically indicates the name of the experimental condition (or group, or both), while \code{numbers} indicate the numbers of the subjects on which function is applied. This system is crucial to keep order in objects and files names and to tell \code{erpR} the correspondence between the objects. In particular a given \code{base} will always refer to the same condition, and a given \code{number} will always refer to the same subject. The data frames containing ERP data (named by the combination of \code{base} and \code{number}) are called \code{erpdf} and  stored in lists called \code{erplists}.

The \code{\link{topoplot}} function of this package uses the function \code{interp} of package \code{akima}, that is released under a non-commercial use license.
