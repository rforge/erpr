\description{
this function creates a new set of \code{data.frame} objects from two sets of paired ERP \code{data.frame} objects. The values are obtained by subtracting the values of the second set from the first set.
}
\usage{
create.diff(base1, base2, numbers, outname = NULL, envir = .GlobalEnv, out.envir = envir, comment.dat = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{base1}{
A vector of strings indicating the beginning of the name of the first series of \code{data.frame} objects containg the ERP data.
}
  \item{base2}{
A vector of strings indicating the beginning of the name of the second series of \code{data.frame} objects containg the ERP data.
}

  \item{numbers}{
The numbers of the subjects to be subtracted by the function.
}

  \item{outname}{
the \code{base} of the names of the returned \code{data.frame} objects.
}

  \item{envir}{
The environment in which \code{grandaverage} is to be evaluated.
}
  \item{out.envir}{
The environment in which the objects created are returned.
}
  \item{comment.dat}{
A number indicating from which set of objects specified in the argument \code{bases} the comment of the data.frame is retrieved.
}
