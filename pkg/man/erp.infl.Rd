\title{
inspect the influence of a subject on the average (single electrode).
}
\description{
This function returns a diagnostic plot to investigate the influence of a given ERP data frame on the grandaverage of a series of ERP data frames. A GUI is provided to explore the effect of removing a data frame (that is expected to be associated with a Subject) on the grandaverage. Two plots are superposed: the original grandaverage and the average removing the subject selected via the GUI.
}

\usage{ 
	erp.infl(base, numbers, electrode, erplist=NULL,  startmsec=-200, 
	endmsec=1200, smo=NULL, outnumber=1, lwd=1, lty=1,  ...)
}

\arguments{
\item{base}{
a string indicating the beginning of the name of the \code{data.frame} containing the ERP data.
}
  \item{numbers}{
the numbers of the subjects to be averaged by the function.
}

  \item{electrode}{
the electrode to be plotted.
}

  \item{erplist}{
a list containing the ERP data frames specified in \code{base} and \code{numbers}.
}

  \item{startmsec}{
the start time (in ms) of the ERP vector.
}
  \item{endmsec}{
the end time (in ms) of the ERP vector.
}

  \item{smo}{
the smoothing parameter to apply (see \code{\link{smooth.spline}}). Default is \code{NULL} and no smoothing is applied.
}

\item{outnumber}{
The number of the subject that will be initially removed from the averaged (this value could be changed also via the GUI).
}

  \item{lwd}{
line width.
}
  
  \item{lty}{
line type.
}

\item{\ldots}{
further parameters to be passed to \code{erp} function called within \code{erp.infl}.
}

}

\details{
The function requires the package \code{rpanel}
}

\value{
The function returns a plot of a single electrode showing the influence of a subject on the grandaverage.
