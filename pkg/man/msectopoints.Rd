\description{
%% internal function of erpR to convert points in msec
}
\usage{
msectopoints(a, lengthsegment, startmsec, endmsec)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{a}{
   a number indicating the ms to be converted in points
}
  \item{lengthsegment}{
    the length (in points) of the segment
}
  \item{startmsec}{
     the time (in ms) of the beginning of the segment
}
  \item{endmsec}{
     the time (in ms) of the end of the segment
}
}
\details{
  this is mostly an internal function of \code{erpR}.
}
\value{
The function return a single value that is the conversion of \code{a} from msec to points.
