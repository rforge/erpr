\title{
 calculate spatial neighbours.
}
\description{
 Internal function for \code{mass.t.test}, used in cluster based permutation to form clusters.
}
\usage{
spatial_neighbours(chanlocs, max_dist, head_radius=NULL)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.

\arguments{
  \item{chanlocs}{
channel locations
}
  \item{max_dist}{
  maximum  distance between electrodes to consider they are neighbours
  }
  \item{head_radius}{
  default is NULL
  }
}
\details{
This is an R translation of spatial_neighbours.m function in MASS univariate toolbox
}


\value{
  An electrodes by electrodes matrix with channel neighbours (1 = neighbouring, 0 = not neighouring).
}
