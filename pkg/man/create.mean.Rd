\title{
create ERP data frames with mean values
}
\description{
This function creates a new set of data frames from two sets of paired ERP data frames by averaging the values of the original sets.
}
\usage{
create.mean(bases, numbers, outname = NULL, envir = .GlobalEnv, 
out.envir = envir, fileinfo = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{bases}{
a vector of strings indicating the beginning of the names of the data frames containing the ERP data to be averaged.
}
  \item{numbers}{
the numbers of the subjects to be averaged.
}

  \item{outname}{
the \code{base} of the names of the returned data frames.
}

  \item{envir}{
the environment in which \code{create.mean} is to be evaluated.
}
  \item{out.envir}{
the environment in which the new objects are returned.
}
  \item{fileinfo}{
a number indicating from which set of objects specified in the argument \code{bases} the information of the data frame is retrieved.
}
}
