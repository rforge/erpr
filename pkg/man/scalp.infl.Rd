\title{
inspect the influence of a subject on an average (scalp array)
}
\description{
The function returns a diagnostic plot to investigate the influence of a given ERP data frame on the grandaverage of a series of ERP data frames. A GUI is provided to explore the effect of removing a data frame (that is expected to be associated with a subject) from the grandaverage. Two plots are superposed: the original grandaverage, and the average removing the subject selected via the GUI. The plot shows an array of electrodes with a topography reflecting their positions on the scalp.

\usage{
scalp.infl(base, numbers, smo = 0, layout = 3, ylims = 12, 
yrev = FALSE, startmsec = -200, endmsec = 1200, lwd = c(1, 2), 
lty = 1, col = "black", out.col = "red", envir = .GlobalEnv,
t.axis=seq(-100,endmsec,200), scalp.array=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{base}{
a string indicating the beginning of the name of the \code{data.frame} containing the ERP data.
}
  \item{numbers}{
the numbers of the subjects to be averaged.
}

 \item{smo}{
the smoothing parameter to apply.
}

  \item{layout}{
A number indicating the layout of electrodes to be plotted. Currently only few default layouts are supported (a number from 1 to 5).
Alternatively, a vector indicating the layout may be supplied (see \code{Details}). 
}
\item{ylims}{
a number indicating the upper and lower limits of the y axis. If "auto", the function calculates the y limits automatically.
}
  \item{yrev}{
logical. If \code{TRUE}, the y-axis is plotted with the negative values upward.
}

 \item{startmsec}{
the start time (in ms) of the ERP vector
}
  \item{endmsec}{
the end time (in ms) of the ERP vector
}

 \item{lwd}{
line width of the waveforms.
}
  \item{lty}{
line type of the waveforms.
}
  \item{col}{
the color of the grand average including all subjects.
}
  \item{out.col}{
the color of the grand average in which the selected subject is removed
}
  \item{envir}{
the environment in which the ERP data frames are searched for.
}
  \item{t.axis}{
the position of the ticks on an additional axis indicating the time. This axis is plotted in the bottom-left corner of the plot array.
}
	\item{scalp.array}{
if a custom \code{layout} is supplied. This argument is vector of two values indicating the number of panels of the plot, as number of rows and number of columns respectively.
	}
}

\details{ The layout parameter can be a number (from 1 to 5), that specify some default electrode arrangements (currently only a few default arrangement are supported). Otherwise, the argument allows to specify a character vector indicating the names of the electrodes to be plotted and their arrangement. The plot is divided in a number of panels as specified in \code{scalp.array}. The names specified will be plotted from top to bottom and from left to right. If \code{"blank"} is specified, then an empty panel will be plotted. If \code{"xaxis"} is specified then an x axis indicating time will be plotted. If \code{"yaxis"} is specified then an y axis indicating voltage will be plotted. 
}
\value{
The function returns a plot showing the influence of a subject on the grandaverage.
