\title{
convert points in milliseconds
}
\description{
An internal function of erpR to convert points in milliseconds.
}
\usage{
pointstomsec(a, lengthsegment, startmsec, endmsec)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{a}{
   a number indicating the point to be converted in ms
}
  \item{lengthsegment}{
    the length (in points) of the segment
}
  \item{startmsec}{
     the time (in ms) of the start of the segment
}
  \item{endmsec}{
     the time (in ms) of the end of the segment
}
}
\details{
  This is mostly an internal function of \code{erpR}.
}
\value{
The function return a single value that is the conversion of \code{a} from points to msec.
