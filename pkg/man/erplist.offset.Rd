\title{
Remove offset in an erplist.
}
\description{
Remove offset (i.e. perform baseline correction) on all the objects of an erplist.
}
\usage{
erplist.offset(base, numbers, win.ini, win.end,
erplist=NULL, startmsec=NULL, endmsec=NULL)

}

\arguments{

\item{base}{
a string indicating the beginning of the name of \code{data.frame} containing ERP data.
}
  \item{numbers}{
the numbers of the subjects to be averaged by the function.
}
  \item{win.ini}{
the initial edge (in ms) of the window on which the offset should be calculated.
}
  \item{win.end}{
the final edge (in ms) of the window on which the offset should be calculated.
}

  \item{erplist}{
a list containing the ERP data frames specified in \code{base} and \code{numbers}.
}

 \item{startmsec}{
the start time (in ms) of the ERP vector
}
  \item{endmsec}{
the end time (in ms) of the ERP vector
}

}

\details{
The function perform a DC offset (or baseline) correction in all he objects of an erplist.
It simply calcualte (separately for each object and each electrode), the mean value in the window specified 
with \code{win.ini}, and \code{win.end} and subtract from all the vector.
}
\value{
A new erplist with the data modified according to the offset correction.
